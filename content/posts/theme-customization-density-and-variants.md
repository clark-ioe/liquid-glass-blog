## Brand Colors

- Update brand tokens in `tailwind.config.js`
- Prefer semantic tokens for future flexibility

## Density

- Adjust paddings/margins in components (e.g., `PostCard` `VARIANT_STYLES`)
- Keep compact/regular/featured variants consistent across breakpoints

## Card Variants

- `default`: balanced
- `featured`: larger image, more text
- `compact`: smaller image, tighter spacing
