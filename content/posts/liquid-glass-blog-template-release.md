## Code Management & Iteration

- This template is actively maintained. It is recommended to set this repository as your upstream to easily sync new features and fixes.
- Fork for custom development and periodically pull updates from upstream.

## Branch Management Best Practices

To develop based on this project and keep up with future updates:

- Fork this repository to your own GitHub account for custom development.
- Set the original repo as your `upstream` to easily fetch new features and bug fixes:
  ```bash
  git remote add upstream https://github.com/clark-ioe/liquid-glass-blog.git
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/main
  # or use rebase if preferred
  git rebase upstream/main
  ```
- Keep your `main` branch stable and production-ready.
- Develop new features in `feature/xxx` branches, then merge into `main`.
- Use `hotfix/xxx` branches for urgent bug fixes.
- Regularly sync with upstream to avoid large codebase divergence and benefit from ongoing improvements.
